<strong><u>What Is This?</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
Media Stealer is a Firefox Add-on dedicated to download Internet resource transfered by HTTP protocol. For primary users, it is designed to download online video, music and flash files(e.g. flash games). However, for advanced users who are familiar with HTTP request &amp; response, Media Stealer can do much more.
</p>
<p>
Media Stealer was originally designed to download flash media (especially the .flv format stream video), so given the name 'Media Stealer'. Unlike other online video download tools (e.g. youtube-dl) or online video retrieve website, the download function is independent of video providers (e.g. YouKu, Tudou, YouTube) as long as they use HTTP protocol.
</p>
<p>
Some of the Media Stealer features include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Very easy to use for beginners and non-professonals
<li>Precisely monitor and filter any HTTP request and response
<li>Powerful detailed configurations provided for advanced users
<li>Monitor download process with the builtin download manager.
</ul>

<strong><u>For Beginners</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
Media Stealer main program can be toggled via the menu of Firefox under "Tools" or via Firefox Add-on bar or pressing Ctrl-Shift-S. Media Stealer doesn't need to be toggled in order to download content.
</p>
<p>
Four panels in main window: Tasks, Options, Rules, Messages. Tasks panel can display downloading progress. 
</p>
<p>
Tasks panel
</p>
<p>
You can only follow downloading progress in Task panel but not control it. This is due to the feature of HTTP protocol. You can monitor the progress in this panel. Status "Finished" means the video is successfully downloaded en stored. "Downloading" means Media Stealer is retieving the data and storing the information. You can delete the tasks and you have the options of deleting the actual file as well. Other task functions are: Rename, Delete, Delete all, Open Download Folder, Copy Url, Copy Urls, Open File. 
</p>
<p>
Options panel
</p>
<p>
The Options panel enables you to select your interested content type--Video, Audio and Flash, also read and change basic settings, and download directory. The download directory is only for static rules. This panel is also able to toggle special features. For example "Disable automatic download" (which is activated by default, once deactivated it downloads automatically content based on rules). Media Stealer can also be temporary deactivated (for example when you don't want to download content) by disabling "Enable Media Stealer".

<strong><u>For Advanced Users</u></strong>
</p>
<p>

You need to have some knowledge about HTTP protocol and javascript regular expression to set more specific settings. For those who are not quite familiar with HTTP request and response, I advice you to watch Debug panel or download another add-on named 'firebug' to learn more. Rules panel is about downloading filter rules. First 3 rules are static, you cannot remove them, but still you can modify them, for they are associated with previous Options. You can double click a rule or press Edit button to open a rule edit window.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Description is some words you describe this rule. This is arbitrary and does not affect download process. </li>
<li>URL is a regular expression can be matched in HTTP request resource url. This is set when you want to download content from a specific site. For example, if you only want to download HD video from heidou(hd.tudou.com), and a video url for example, http://125.39.48.17/mp4/021/159/131/21159131.f4v?18000&key=5c49da497c1128a28ba84249ec7d062422d102, you observe that string 'mp4' or 'f4v' or IP address in url, so you need to set this to 'mp4' or 'f4v', or a regular expression matching an IP address( e.g, "((2[0-4]\d|25[0-5]|[01]?\d\d?)\.){3}((2[0-4]\d|25[0-5]|[01]?\d\d?))" ). </li>
<li>Content-Type (MIME type) is a regular expression can be matched in HTTP responce content-type. Take previous example, this can be set to 'octet-stream'.</li>
<li>You can add a rule that filters specific websites by example using "http:\/\/.+(\.youtube\.com)" as URL in the rules and "video|flv|f4v|mp4" as its content-type. It is possible that youtube also needs the following content type: swf|flash|shockwave</li>
<li>Directory is where you want to save your downloaded files. The download folder of static rules is controlled in the Options panel. The download folder of custom rules can be changed via the "edit" button of a custom rule.</li>
</ol>
<p>
One thing I need to remind you is: functions of Media Stealer add-on is not limited to media data downloading. It can be used to download many other types of content that sent to your internet browser. You can do many amazing things if you configure it well. 
</p>
<p>
As to the last Messages panel, it is for those who want to read, debug or modify the source code of this add-on. It's convient.
