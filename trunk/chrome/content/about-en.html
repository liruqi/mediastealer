<strong><u>What is Media Stealer</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
Media Stealer is a Firefox Add-on dedicated to download Internet resource transfered by HTTP protocol. For primary users, it is designed to download online video, music and flash files(e.g. flash games). However, for advanced users who are familiar with HTTP request &amp; response, Media Stealer can do much more.
</p>
<p>
<strong><u>How to access Media Stealer</u></strong>
</p>
<img src="chrome://stealer/skin/0.jpg">
<p>
It's highly recommended to activate the add-on menu. In the Firefox menu, click on View, Toolbars and finally Add-on bar. You can also access the main program via Firefox menu, Tools and finally Media Stealer.
</p>
<p>
<strong><u>Media Stealer icons</u></strong>
</p>
<img src="chrome://stealer/skin/1.jpg">
<p>
You'll see two icons on the Firefox Add-on bar. One is a start/stop icon, which enables/disables Media stealer. Once disabled, Media Stealer will not show a download dialog and will not download content, except previous tasks. The other icon is to toggle the main program. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><u>A download dialog</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
When content such as Flash is detected, Media Stealer will automatically display the dialog above. When 'Ask every time. Can be (re)activated via Firefox menu or Add-on bar' is unchecked, it will automatically download content without asking. It can be reactivated via the Media Stealer icon. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><u>Tasks panel of media stealer</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
Click on the Media Stealer icon to toggle the main program. 
<br>
You'll see four panels. Let's focus on the first panel, called "tasks". It shows all the current downloads and their destination folder. You can monitor their progress. The status can be "downloading", "paused", "interrupted" or "finished". 
<br>
You can always open the download directory by pressing "Open folder", so you know where the download will go. You can always copy the URL or URL's from task(s).
<br>
When downloading, the task can be paused by pressing the "pause" button. And can be resumed by the "resume" button.
<br>
When downloading, the task can also be aborted by pressing the "abort" button. This will effectively abort the task and delete the downloaded file. Please be careful.
<br>
Once the download is finished, you can rename the file, open the file. Double clicking on the task, will also open the file.
<br>
When clicked on "Delete", a dialog will be represented. It will ask you to delete the task with the option to remove the downloaded file. Be careful, when the option to remove the download is checked and you press OK, the downloaded file will be removed from disc. The same applies to "delete all".
<br>
You can also right click on any task for a menu with the same functions as the buttons.
</p>
<p>
<strong><u>Options panel of media stealer</u></strong>
</p>
<img src="chrome://stealer/skin/4.jpg">

<p>
The next panel is called "options". Here you can finetune the behavior of Media Stealer. Here you can set the download directory. This will only apples to the standard rules. For rules, please read section "rules". 
<br>
In the options panel, on left side, you can quickly activate/deactivate video, audio and flash. 
<br>
On the right side, the first option is to enable/disable Media Stealer. When disabled, media stealer will not ask to download content and content will be not downloaded except previous tasks. Enabled by default.
<br>
The second option ensures you'll be immediately asked to download content. When this option is unchecked, it will automatically download content, without asking. Enabled by default.
<br>
The third option retrieves data (content) from cache, which is faster than downloading it again. Enabled by default.
<br>
The fourth option, when unchecked, disables the start/stop icon of Media Stealer. Enabled by default.
<br>
The firth one ensures that all files are given the "flv" extention when the filetype is unknown. This is entirely based on the content-type. The content type is defined in the "Rules" panel. Enabled by default.
<br>
The sixth one is a bit tricky one. When this option is enabled, unwanted files can be avoided (such as flash players). However, if a valid file is smaller than than 750 000 bytes, you'll not be prompted to download something. Disabled by default.
<br>
The seventh options ensures that empty files (such as cookies) will not be downloaded. Enabled by default.
<br>
The eight option ensures when you download something, Media Stealer will ask where you want the download on your hard disk. You can also rename at the same time. This is disabled by default.
<br>
Please chose "Apply" or "OK" to save the new settings. "OK", will close Media Stealer.
</p>
<p>
<strong><u>Rules panel of media stealer</u></strong>
</p>
<img src="chrome://stealer/skin/5.jpg">
<p>
The "Rules" panels opens rules. There are two kinds, builtin ones, such as Video. The other kind are custom rules, which is entirely defined and made by the end user. The builtin ones can be changed. It's strongly recommend that this can only changed by an experienced/professional user. If you don't know what you're doing, stay away.
<br>
You can import/export rules. You can rearrange the order of the rules. This will not have an effect on the download experience. You can add/delete/create rules. The builtin ones cannot be deleted. Each rule can be enabled/disabled.
</p>
<p>
<strong><u>Detail window of new rule</u></strong>
</p>
<img src="chrome://stealer/skin/6.jpg">
<p>
When you create a new rule a window should popup. Here you can enter a description (for example Images), a URL based on regex. For any URL's, please enter "http://\/\/" without quotes. Content-type can be for example "png|jpg|tiff|png", please use "|" (piping symbol) as a separator. Each custom rule can have a separate download directory.
<br>

<br>
<br>
You need to have some knowledge about HTTP protocol and javascript regular expression to set more specific settings. For those who are not quite familiar with HTTP request and response, I advice you to watch Debug panel or download another add-on named 'firebug' to learn more. 
<ol>
<li>URL is a regular expression can be matched in HTTP request resource url. This is set when you want to download content from a specific site. For example, if you only want to download HD video from heidou(hd.tudou.com), and a video url for example, http://125.39.48.17/mp4/021/159/131/21159131.f4v?18000&key=5c49da497c1128a28ba84249ec7d062422d102, you observe that string 'mp4' or 'f4v' or IP address in url, so you need to set this to 'mp4' or 'f4v', or a regular expression matching an IP address( e.g, "((2[0-4]\d|25[0-5]|[01]?\d\d?)\.){3}((2[0-4]\d|25[0-5]|[01]?\d\d?))" ). </li>
<li>Content-Type (MIME type) is a regular expression can be matched in HTTP responce content-type. Take previous example, this can be set to 'octet-stream'.</li>
<li>You can add a rule that filters specific websites by example using "http:\/\/.+(\.yourfavoritemoviessite\.com)" as URL in the rules and "video|flv|f4v|mp4|octet-stream" as its content-type.</li>
</ol>
